## Potential Insights and Actions Based on the Dashboard:
1. **Seasonal Planning:**
    - **Promotions and Maintenance:** Schedule promotional activities and bike maintenance during high usage periods, particularly around mid-year when ridership is at its peak.
    - **Inventory Management:** Make sure there are sufficient bikes available to meet the demand during busy times.
    - **Staffing Adjustments:** Efficiently manage staff by increasing the workforce during peak periods and reducing during low usage times.

2. **Weather Considerations:**
    - **Operational Changes:** Adapt operations according to weather forecasts. For example, expect lower usage on very cold or extremely windy days.
    - **Safety Protocols:** Implement safety measures during adverse weather conditions to ensure rider safety and maintain confidence.

3. **Marketing Strategies:**
    - **Targeted Campaigns:** Develop marketing campaigns based on temperature and wind speed data to boost ridership. For example, promote riding during ideal weather conditions (14.9°C - 17.4°C and 10.7 kph - 21.4 kph wind speeds).

4. **Future Planning:**
    - **Infrastructure Development:** Plan and invest in infrastructure improvements during less busy times to minimize disruption and prepare for future growth.
